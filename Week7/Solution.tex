	\section{Theoretical Problems}
		\subsection{Part 1.}
			\subsubsection{Question}
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item \noindent Your company has been granted a contract to develop the next generation of electronic cigarette, also 
					known as a “nicotine delivery system,” and you have been assigned to the design team. Can you in good 
					conscience contribute your expertise to this project? Write in details: issues, stakeholders, 
					consequences action you might take
					
					\item Choose \textbf{one}~of the following industries then:
					\begin{enumerate} [a.]
						\item Apply the four-step ethical decision-making procedure to gain insight into the nature of the decision to be made\\
						\noindent (what the issue and who is effected by the alterntives, alternatives from other prespectives and their correlation, suggest an action)
						
						\item Give at least one more ethical issue in the indutry you choose
					\end{enumerate}
					\noindent Choose one:
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item Food processing industry (one issue Excess use of (fat/sugar/salt))
						\item International manufacturing companies (one issue poor labor practice in other countries)
						\item Various chemical industries (one issue Pesticide effect on ecosystem)
					\end{enumerate}
				\end{enumerate}
			
			\subsubsection{Solution}
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item \\
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item Step 1: Identify and see if there is a problem, and if who is affected by it. \\
							\begin{itemize}
								\item Issues:
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Nicotine is very addictive and detrimental for your body.
									\item This device / product might misdirect a lot of people into thinking that it will help them to stop smoking while in reality it could be worse.
									\item Health care lawsuits / Protests against the product.
									\item If this product becomes popular, there will be a huge decline in tobacco sales.
									\item Refusing to make this product can get you fired.
									\item Halting the production can cause huge money loss.
								\end{itemize}
							
								\item Stakeholders:
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Nicotine addicts that are trying to recover
									\item The User
									\item Young people
									\item The company
									\item Tobacco farmers
									\item You
								\end{itemize}
							\end{itemize}
						
							\item Step 2: Analyze alternative courses of action from different perspectives.
							\begin{itemize}
								\item Consequences:
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Future lawsuits will come.
									\item You might lose your job.
									\item A lot of people might develop health problems
								\end{itemize}
							
								\item Intent:
								\begin{itemize}
									\item People who struggle with nicotine addiction should \important{not} use this product.
									\item People who use this device risk getting addicted to nicotine.
									\item People might overcome their tobacco addiction.
									\item The company will make a lot of \textcolor{green}{\$\$\$}
								\end{itemize}
							
								\item Character
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Person of good character would \important{not} condone the use of this device.
									\item Person of good character \important{could}~use this device without damaging their reputation.
									\item My spiritual leader would \important{not} condone the use of this device.
								\end{itemize}
							
							\end{itemize}
							
							\pagebreak
							\item Step 3: Correlate perspectives.
							\begin{itemize}
								\item While it is true that this device can help people resolve their smoking addiction, it will still affect the consumers health because nicotine is poisonous.
								\noindent This device doesn't benefit people who are non smokers, nor does it do good for the company because of the legal lawsuits it would face from all the health
								\noindent~concerns.
							\end{itemize}
						
							\item Step 4: My decision
							\begin{itemize}
								\item I do \important{not} condone the use of this device for the soul reason that it has more negative over positives, and all the positives it has all come with their side-effects.
							\end{itemize}
						\end{enumerate}
					\item \miniHeader{Food processing industry (one issue Excess use of (fat/sugar/salt))} \\
						\begin{enumerate}
								\item Step 1: Identify and see if there is a problem, and who is affected by it.
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Issues:
									\begin{itemize}
										\item Health problems
										\item Possible lawsuits
									\end{itemize}
									
									\item Stakeholders:
									\begin{itemize}
										\item Young children
										\item Industry food consumers
										\item Students (Because no \textcolor{green}{\$\$\$}, can't get good food :( spent it all on my car)
										\item Company
									\end{itemize}
								\end{itemize}
								
								\item Step 2: Analyze alternative courses of action from different perspectives:
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Consequences:
									\begin{itemize}
										\item Diabetes 
										\item Heart problems
										\item Sugar Rush
										\item Kidney problems
									\end{itemize}
								
									\item Intent:
									\begin{itemize}
										\item Young kids should not be given food with too much sugar, because it has a high probability of giving them a sugar rush.
										\item People should not consume food with a lot of fat, because it increases the chance of a heart attack.
										%\item \includegraphics{}
									\end{itemize}
								
									\item Character:
									\begin{itemize}
										\item Person of good character would \important{not} condone the selling of food products with high amount of salt,sugar, or fat.
										\item Person of good character would \important{not} sell these products.
									\end{itemize}
								\end{itemize}
								
								\item Step 3: Correlate perspectives.
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Products that have an excess amount of fat/sugar/salt are extremely cheap, and very damaging to a person's health.
								\end{itemize}
							
								\item Step 4: My decision
								\begin{itemize}
									\item I do \important{not} suggest consumption nor selling of products with excess amount of fat/sugar/salt do to their high levels of risk to health.
								\end{itemize}
						\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Part 4.}
		\subsubsection{Question}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item What are the steps in designing a solution to a problem?
				\item What are the constraints faced in designing solution for engineering problems?
			\end{enumerate}
		\subsubsection{Solution}
			\noindent The steps in designing a solution to a problem are: \vspace{2mm}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Define the problem;
				\item Generate concepts;
				\item Develop a solution;
				\item Construct and test the prototype;
				\item Evaluate the solution(if not valid go to step 3);
				\item Present the solution;
			\end{enumerate}
		
	\subsection{Part 5.}
		\subsubsection{Question}
			\noindent An engineer works at an automobile manufacturing facility. His tests show that there is 1\% probability that the brake system might fail. He informs his manager of his findings. However, his manager stresses the importance of shipping the new automobiles on time because any  more delays in production will cause massive financial losses. He asks the engineer to ignore the test results and concentrate on meeting  the delivery deadlines.
		\subsubsection{Solution}
			\noindent While no question here was asked, we are guessing this has to do with the choice that the engineer should make. Here it is a classical ethical question if the engineer should push this product. If the engineer does not push out the product in time he will cause a huge financial loss to the company which will most likely lead him to getting fired, on the other side if he does push this product he will be putting a lot of peoples lives at risk. So the engineer should \important{not} push this product out.
